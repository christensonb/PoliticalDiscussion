Summary
=======

Flowers is asking for a mistrial based on Batson because it is alleged that the
prosecution appears to have excluded black jurors because he thought they would 
be less likely to convict because of their race.

This is an unusual case, because it was tried six times by the same prosecutor
in the same district.  The district only has 5000 people, so it is difficult to 
find jurors who aren't connected to the case.


Batson Rules
============
1.  You can't pick or strike jurors on the basis of race...
2.  The history [pg. 24.3]- There must be history of abuse and the District 
        Attorney counts
3.  The consequence is to nulify the verdict and have a retrial 
  
    
People
======
- Ms. Johnson - lawyer for the defense at supreme court
- Mr. Evans  - prosecutor during the trial
- Carolyn Wright - most egregious black jury member struck in the last (6th) trial.
- Ms. Chesteen - white juror who was not struck down.

Previous Trials
===============
Trial 1 — Lee County, 1997
The jury was all white.
Flowers was found guilty of murdering Bertha Tardy 
and he was sentenced to death.
This conviction was overturned by the Mississippi 
Supreme Court in 2000. The Court found that Evans 
"unfairly prejudiced" the jury by introducing evidence 
related to the deaths of the other victims when Flowers was 
not on trial for those crimes. Evans also improperly argued 
facts which were not in evidence, the court said.

Trial 2 — Harrison County, 1999
Eleven members of the jury were white. One was black.
The jury found Flowers guilty of murdering Derrick "BoBo" 
Stewart. He was sentenced to death.
Again, the state Supreme Court shot down a murder conviction 
because of prosecutorial misconduct. Evans improperly tried all 
four murders at a trial meant for one count of murder. Evans 
argued facts that were not in evidence, the court said, 
and misstated facts in his closing statement.
 
Trial 3 — Montgomery County, 2004
Eleven members of the jury were white. One was black.
The jury found Flowers guilty on four counts of murder. 
He was sentenced to death
This conviction was reversed because the state Supreme 
Court found that Evans racially discriminated against black
 potential jurors during the jury selection.

Trial 4 — Montgomery County, 2007
Seven members of the jury were white. Five were black.
The trial ended with a hung jury. The judge declared a mistrial.
The jury deadlocked. They were split along racial lines, with 
the white jurors voting to convict and the black jurors 
voting to acquit.

Trial 5 — Montgomery County, 2008
Nine members of the jury were white. Three were black.
The trial ended with a hung jury and, again, a judge declared it a mistrial.
This deadlocked jury had 11 members voting in favor of guilt.

One black juror voted to acquit Flowers. He had told fellow jurors 
that he was in the alley not long before the killings in 1996 and 
didn't see anything. The judge had the juror arrested for lying 
uring jury questioning because he did not say that he had personal 
knowledge about the case.

A grand jury indicted the juror for perjury, then the charges 
were dropped after it was determined that no jurors were asked 
if they had personal knowledge of the crime.

Trial 6 — Montgomery County, 2010
Eleven members of the jury were white. One was black.
The jury found Flowers guilty on four counts of murder. 
He was sentenced to death
When appealed, the Mississippi Supreme Court upheld Flowers' 
conviction. Two years later, the U.S. Supreme Court told state 
justices to take another look, particularly on whether there 
was discrimination in how some black potential jurors were excluded.

Conclusion
==========

Ben
---
I disagree with the Mississippi SC that there wasn't history.  I think its 
fairly straight forward and obvious that if there were two other cases of 
Batson then there is history of Batson.

I also strongly disagree with SC Justice Breyer that Mr. Evans act of excluding 
Ms. Wright over Ms. Chesteen proves Batson.  I don't think it is reasonable to 
say that give those two jurors (minus race) that a prosecutor wouldn't have 
struck down Ms. Wright over Ms. Chesteen.

I do agree this case falls under Batson violation, not because of what the 
prosecutor did but because of what he didn't do; which is to not question the 
white jurors or to say he investigated white jurors.

That being said I don't this Mr. Flowers is a victim, I think the community is
the victim, and the prosecutor should be retired for not moving the case to 
another district.  This would have required letting another person win his case, 
and although I can understand how that is hard on him he should have been 
professional and done what was in the best interest of the state.
