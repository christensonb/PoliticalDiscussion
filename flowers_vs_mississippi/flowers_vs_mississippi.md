Summary
=======

Flowers is asking for a mistrial based on Batson because it is alleged that the
prosecution appears to have excluded black jurors because he thought they would 
be less likely to convict because of their race.

This is an unusual case, because it was tried six times by the same prosecutor
in the same district.  The district only has 5000 people, so it is difficult to 
find jurors who aren't connected to the case.

Criteria
--------
The criteria for Batson violation requires the following:
1. History [pg. 24.3]- There must be history of abuse.
2. The prosecutor cannot appear to strike members because of their race.
   
  
People
======
- Ms. Johnson - lawyer for the defense at supreme court
- Mr. Evans  - prosecutor during the trial
- Carolyn Wright - most egregious black jury member struck in the last (6th) trial.
- Ms. Chesteen - white juror who was not struck down.
